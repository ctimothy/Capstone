Validating the Malmquist Productivity Index for Industry Change:  The Case of Major League Baseball
 
# Abstract

Several articles use the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to evaluate different industries performances over time. At issue is these articles use a very small set of DMUs over a short time frame to validate the usefulness of the MPI, as raised by their authors. Therefore, validating MPI properly requires a large and verified data set. To address the number DMU issues and validate the MPI, this article utilizes the Lehman’s Baseball Database, which spans baseballs rich history from 1871 to 2015. First validation happens by picking major events and verifying an index change at that particular time. The second validation takes index change and matches it to an event in baseball history. 

# Introduction 

The Malmquist index was introducing in a paper written by Professor Sten Malmquist in 1953 [@fare_memoriam_2005]. The paper entitled _Index numbers and indifference surfaces_ spelled out the theory of "cost of living indexes and uses the duality between the expenditure and distance functions to integrate price and quantity index indexes in the Consumer context." In 1982, two papers were published that used the Malmquist Index to create what is now affectionately known as the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) [@fare_memoriam_2005].  The authors Caves, Christensen and Diewer took the Malmquist Index and developed a producer context to construct an index of productivity change. The first article using Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist was written by James Odeck in 1993 [odeck_measuring_1993]. 

## Data envelopment analysis

Introduction to DEA
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) used to evaluate several different producers and their efficiency.  Classic non-DEA methods evaluate producers against an average producer. DEA takes another approach and compares producer’s bases on only the best producers of the group. Comparing producers or decision-making unit (DMU) is one of the extreme point methods. 
Given producer A, the inputs of X(A) will produce Y(A) units of output. If other producers operate efficiently, they should be able to do the same.  By combining all producers into a composite or virtual producer with composite inputs and composite outputs, the most effient producer is generated. Then producer A and the others can be compared to the virtual producer.  If producer A is worse than virtual producer by either making less output with the same input or making the same output with more input, then it is said that producer is ineffient. 
For a more in-depth discussion of DEA, the interested reader is referred to Seiford and Thrall [1990] or the seminal work by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes [1978].

# Malquist

Before using the Malmquist Productivity Index, it must be validated in this use. Is it valid for locating changes in technical progress or technical efficiency, thus allowing us to identify the cause?

To validate Malmquist Productivity Index, a large amount of verified data is required. The data must be One data source that meets these requirements is Baseball Player performance data for 1871 through 2014 found in the Lahman Baseball Database.  The advantages of using this database is
·         Long history of sophisticated methods applied to baseball
·         Can provide better understanding to the underlying models
·         Rich and very accurate historical data
·         Well understood history and easily understood application
Using the database to validate the Malmquist Productivity Index, we can prove the following hypotheses
·         H1:  Immature industries show highly variable performance
·         H2: Rule changes, etc. result in a significant frontier shift
o   In favor of hitters will result in a positive frontier shift in the the year that they first take effect
o   In favor of pitchers (against hitters) will result in a negative frontier shift in the the year that they first take effect
·         H3: New and “Exceptional” performers (ex. with new best practices) will result in:
o   A positive industrywide frontier shift in their their “first” year (P>1)
o   Decrease in efficiency as most people suffer in comparison to the star. (E<1)
o   Returns to stable if their performance stays at that level, later years (P, E=1)
·         H4:  Years without changes should generally have little frontier shift
o   Both frontier shift and efficiency change are about 1.0 (P, E=1)
